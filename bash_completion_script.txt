Filename completion in bash (or any other shell like zsh, fish, etc.) is a feature of what's known as a "readline library". When you type a few characters and then press the tab key, the readline library looks for any files or directories that start with those characters and completes the rest for you. 

To add such autocompletion for your own program, you need to supply a bash completion script. This is typically placed somewhere like `/etc/bash_completion.d/` or `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/`. 

The script is written for the `bash-completion` package and it uses the bash `complete` built-in command extensively.

Here is a really basic example of an autocomplete script for a hypothetical python program:

```bash
#/etc/bash_completion.d/my_script

_my_script() {
    local cur prev opts
    COMPREPLY=()
    cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
    prev="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}"
    opts="--help --verbose --version"

    if [[ ${cur} == -* ]] ; then
        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${opts}" -- ${cur}) )
        return 0
    fi
}
complete -F _my
